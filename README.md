## About
UD Annotatrix is a client-side, browser-only, language-independent tool for editing dependency trees according to the guidelines established by the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org) project.  UD-Annotatrix supports uploading corpora to the browser to add, remove, and edit dependencies in a wide variety of formats (managed with the [notatrix](https://github.com/keggsmurph21/notatrix) tool), including:
 - [CoNLL-U](http://universaldependencies.org/format.html)
 - [VISL CG3](http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/single/#streamformats)
 - Brackets
 - SDParse
 - plain text

Note: [brat](http://brat.nlplab.org) and [CoNLLUEditor](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/conllueditor) are similar corpus annotation tools, but UD Annotatrix aims to be a simple(r), clean(er), fast(er) interface optimized for Universal Dependencies with an optional server-side component.

| edit dependency relation | click on the dependency arrow |
| remove heads | right-click on the dependency arrow, press `x`, `Backspace`, or `Delete` |
| edit part of speech labels | click on the light purple blobs below the blue 'form node' |
| edit tokens | right-click on the blue 'form node' |
| split token | click on the blue 'form node', press `s`, insert a `Space` character anywhere in the box, press `Enter` |
| split multi-word token | click on the lighter blue 'multi-word' node, press `s` |

## Getting started

UD Annotatrix can be used in several different ways.  Some methods don't require a server backend, although this restricts the available features.

Many of these methods require the `node` and `npm` executables.  To check if you have these, run `node -v`.  If you don't, you can find installation instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

| feature | local dynamic server | remote dynamic server | local static file | locally served static files | remotely served static files |
| ----------------------------- | --- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| create and edit trees         | ✔   |  ✔ |  ✔ |  ✔ |  ✔ |
| edit GitHub-hosted treebanks  |     |    |    |    |    |
| collaborative editing         | (✔) |  ✔ |  ✖ |  ✖ |  ✖ |

| *HOW TO RUN*         | `npm server` |    | open in browser | `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` | github.io |



### serve dynamic files

Run a copy of UD Annotatrix with server backend on your machine.  Uploaded databases will be saved directly to your hard drive.  This is the recommended method.  To install, run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonorthwash/ud-annotatrix
cd ud-annotatrix/
npm install
```
You can configure the environment in several ways by setting `KEY=VALUE` pairs in the `.env` file (see [the server configuration file](server/config.js)).

To run the server, run `npm run dev-server` in the project directory root, then navigate your browser to `localhost:5316`.  If you would like to deploy your own copy of UD Annotatrix, you could alternately run `npm run server`.

### remote (dynamic) server

Access a copy of UD Annotatrix with server backend running on another machine.  Uploaded databases will be saved on the remote server.  Some currently active remote servers:
 - [Kevin's website](`http://annotator.murp.us/`)

### as a static file

Run a copy of UD Annotatrix without the server backend from a static file.  This version does __not__ have a server backend, so [some features](#features) will be unavailable.  Uploaded databases will be saved into `localStorage`.  Navigate your browser to `file:///path/to/ud-annotatrix/index.html`.

### serving static files

Serve up a copy of the UD Annotatrix static site.  This version does __not__ have a server backend, so [some features](#features) will be unavailable.  Uploaded databases will be saved into `localStorage`.  To start the server, `cd` to the project directory root and run `python -m http.server`.  The files should be available at `localhost:8000`.

If you want to host the static files, you can do so by

### remote (static) files

Access a copy of the UD Annotatrix static site on another machine.  This version does __not__ have a server backend, so [some features](#features) will be unavailable.  Uploaded databases will be saved into `localStorage`.  Some currently active remote static servers (items marked with '\*' are running older versions):

## User guide

The basic user guide is available on the [help page](https://maryszmary.github.io/ud-annotatrix/standalone/help.html).

## Contributing

We welcome your pull requests!  To get started, fork this repository and run (where `$REPO` gives the fork's URL)
```bash
git clone $REPO
cd ud-annotatrix
npm install
```

Whenever you make changes, you will need to regenerate some of the source files.  You can do that with
```bash
npm run build        # just build everything once
npm run build-watch  # build now watch the source code for changes
```

If you make changes to any of the files in the [`notatrix/`](notatrix/) directory, you'll need to recompile the TypeScript files as well.  You can do that with
```bash
npm --prefix notatrix/ run build        # just build everything once
npm --prefix notatrix/ run build-watch  # build now watch the source code for changes
```
